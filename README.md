# learning_python

This repository contains some Python code that I wrote while learning the language. It is not intended to be a tutorial or a guide, but it may be useful for someone who is learning Python.

And also, learning/ testing the [Jupyter Notebook](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).
